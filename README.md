# GendL Solution for Advent of Code 2022

These are written in GendL, a declarative demand-driven programming
framework embedded in Common Lisp. 

You can learn about GendL (how to install it etc) at https://gornschool.com.

Also if your version of GendL doesn't have `le` please use `list-elements` instead, and for `theo` use `the-object`.
